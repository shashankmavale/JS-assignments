    Take a number from a user and write a function which checks whether the number is even or odd. Assign the result to a variable and log that variable in the console.
    <script>
        var num=prompt("Please Enter a number",0);
        console.log("Input: "+num);
        if (num%2==0){
            console.log("The number entered is "+num+" and Number is Even");
        } else{
            console.log("The number entered is "+num+"and Number is Odd");
        }
