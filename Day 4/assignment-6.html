    <h2>Day 4 Q.6.</h2>
    Rewrite the function using '?' or '||'
    Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them
    to input again.
    The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the
    input/enters an empty line.
    Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special
    handling for a non-numeric input in this task.
